	Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.
	This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.

	You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8. The number
	will correspond to the board postion as illustrated:

                                0 | 1 | 2
                                ---------

                                6 | 7 | 8
